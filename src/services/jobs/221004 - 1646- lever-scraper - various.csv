The weekly gatherings strive to achieve this objective by using a mixture of networking, mentoring, and engaging educational programming.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Today, there are Venture Cafés in Cambridge (Massachusetts), St. Louis (Missouri), Rotterdam (The Netherlands), Miami (Florida), Tokyo (Japan), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Sydney (Australia), Providence (Rhode Island), Warsaw (Poland), Phoenix (Arizona), and Monterrey (Mexico). Multiple additional locations are in the works, and we hope to support the creation of dozens more.</div><div><br></div><div>VCGI has a direct, central staff of 5. Together with the teams at each cafe location, approximately 98 people operate the Venture Café platform around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In the cities in which we operate we quickly become the largest, best known, and best attended regular gathering of innovators and entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Through these gatherings, and other programs and activities of our cafes, we aim to increase the level of innovation and entrepreneurship in our cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since 2009, we have convened in total over 550,000 innovators, creatives, developers and civic-minded leaders around the world, building a global community of entrepreneurs and innovators that provides​ open access to capital in a multitude of ways; human, social, economic, intellectual and political capital. The sectors serviced and businesses formed range from high tech innovations to less tech enabled services</div><div><br></div><div>Each Venture Café location is typically funded by local leading innovation players: universities, consortia, governmental agencies, and operators of innovation-focused buildings and districts. Individual cafes may either be directly owned and operated by VCGI, or may be a licensee operating under VCGI guidelines and frameworks.</div><div><br></div><div>VCGI, legally the ""CIC Venture Cafe Global Institute"", is structured as a Delaware public benefit company (PBC) which reinvests all of its income in its mission. It was founded by Tim Rowe and incubated by Cambridge Innovation Center (a global operator of shared workspaces for innovators it calls innovation campuses). Later, it was spun out as a separate organization. CIC remains a close strategic partner and sponsor. CIC’s collaboration includes space donation for events within its locations as well as payroll and benefits administration at some locations, and direct management support for local Venture Cafe teams in others.</div><div><br></div><div>VCGI is funded by an annual USD $45K fee paid into the center by each local cafe. &nbsp;It provides the member cafes guidance, service and support to the network, much like the secretariat of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>ABOUT THE ROLE</b></div><div>VCGI seeks a dynamic, creative, and energetic leader as its President.
